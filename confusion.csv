5,"I am a Plumber-Turned-BIM Detailer. The position has many different titles. My official title is Mechanical Designer/Detailer and I work in Design/Build - So I design/detail piping systems and our field guys install them. I will go ahead and answer your questions in order, to help you out the best I can.\n\n1. What are some of your primary responsibilities?\n\nEveryday is different, but my workload normally consists of answering many emails, drawing pipe/fittings/equipment into the BIM Model, creating 2-D prints for many purposes, 3-D scanning and rendering 3-d scans for later reference, also, I answer any questions posed from the field supervisor on the prints/plans for construction.\n\n2. What does an average day-to-day routine look like?\n\nI have a pretty autonomous schedule and work from home mainly. I will head into the office or on-site as needed though. I work full-time, but my hours are fairly flexible. I usually wake up sometime between 6-8am and work til 4-6pm (I do work many 10-12hr days, although it is not required at all. I just really enjoy my job.). I do however get onsite very early at times, so my wake up/start times vary depending on project needs.\n\n3. What do you like? What don't you like?\n\na) Every company is different. So, I will answer this solely from a ""job-role"" perspective. I really enjoy technology, so I really like working with the BIM process. There is never a dry moment for me. There is always something new to learn and there is no way to learn every facet of this niche in the industry, so I never get bored. This is the main thing I enjoy about the job, everything else I like has to do with the company. Finding a good employer is a big part of job satisfaction as well. so, if you can sit in front of a computer all day (like I can) and get interested in the tech, then you will be fine in this role.\n\nb) In the past, there has always been a disconnect between the engineers and the installers. That is where we fit in. So our biggest hurdle is communication. It is hard to get what we need out of the engineers/architects at times, and it can be difficult to find the information you need to do your job. In the end, if there is a problem with the communication of the job, the Designers and Detailers get blamed, even though it may not be our fault. Not complaining, but it is part of the job, considering our whole job is passing information from one party to another.\n\n4. Best advice for someone trying to move towards this career?\n\nSo, moving from the field to this (for me) was a weird experience. I myself started in a BIM role right around the time I received my plumbing license, so I was still in my apprenticeship technically (right around where you are). Having been in a similar position to yours, My advice would be as follows:\n\n1. Understand that if you get a BIM job and you decide to stay in BIM, then your career as an electrician is pretty much over. I have received plenty of shit for having a Plumbing License, yet never working in the field as a Journeyman. In the end, people respect my knowledge of the field, but I am no longer a Plumber. I am a Detailer with a respectable amount of plumbing knowledge. I say this, because it was a hard pill to swallow for me, considering I original plan was to be a Plumber my whole career.\n2. I will tell you something that a wise Master Plumber told me when I was offered my current position. ""It is very difficult to move to the office from the field, but very easy to come back."" There is a large shortage of skilled tradesman, so you can always come back to the field if you don't like sitting in front of a computer all day. Despite what I said in my first point, if you don't like the office life, then you still will have a license to fall back on.\n3. I got my job doing 3 things, so this is what I recommend you do to get a BIM role from the field. Work your ass off in the field and be a great apprentice/journeyman. Learn some AutoCAD/Revit/Navisworks and BIM practices in your spare time (and find a love for learning - it matters). Get a LinkedIn and start networking - tell people your goals and what you are doing to achieve them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helped, I know it was pretty lengthy, but I read someone was in the exact scenario I was in a few years ago, so I had to say something. Thing worked out for me and I am very happy with my job/life, but everybody is different. This job suits me, but it may not suit you. So, if you have an interest in BIM, then try to achieve your goal and see what you think of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWish you the best!","{'polarity': 0.2190832500832501, 'subjectivity': 0.5188904428904427, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.2190832500832501,0.5188904428904427,Neutral

But if you're in both...\n\n> The solution is to get the surveyor to make the coordination file\n\nAnd then they start asking all kinds of questions 😄 For a site with existing buildings, I can supply the structural grids/plans (which only considered local units/coordinates) and specify which intersection will be used as base point. Then ask for a survey point which will use in Revit.\n\nDo I have to worry about scaling or is the whole point that civil and buildings are in the same coordinates / same scale and the location + rotation via shared coordinates takes care of everything?\n\nDoes it matter if the original grids are mostly set out in survey feet (aside from just converting the units) while related building grids are simply ""feet"" when they're overlaid?

If I was trying to build software for viewing a model on a client's computer or something this could be great, but if I was trying to build software to automatically check for modelling errors in real time, then that course would be less useful since the main thing you would need to know is how to interact with the Revit / Archicad APIs.\n\nIn terms of whether or not the career will be in demand in general though, I know of quite a few major architecture and construction firms that write in house software and I suspect that will only grow over time as the ease of writing software continues to decrease and the demand for quality software tailored to your company's specific workflows increases. \n\nOf course, that being said, writing good BIM software requires a lot of the same general software architecture and coding skillsets that it takes to write any other form of software, so I know that a lot of us who started in BIM software eventually just got poached into the general software development / tech industry since they're usually willing to pay higher salaries than the aec industry, and you may be able to get better training and mentorship for software development there. In general though, software development skills are highly transferable across industries so I wouldn't worry about those skills not being in demand, unless you specifically want to stay in the AEC industry, in which case there's fewer guarantees since it will depend on whether the (relatively) small number of players want to write in house software or not.","{'polarity': 0.15182692307692308, 'subjectivity': 0.43519230769230766, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.15182692307692308,0.43519230769230766,Neutral

90,"I have been using Navis since it was first acquired by Autodesk in 2007 and I can assure you I've found what the better approaches are when clashing, and clashing MEP vs MEP as a whole (duct, piping, fire protection, electrical, lighting, plumbing and technology) is absolutely the way to go. What you'll want to do is go to the Rules tab first and check the ""ignore"" checkboxes for Same Layer, Same Group and Same file, then go to the Select tab and click all NWC's in both columns to clash everything versus everything. \n\nNow here's the pro tip of the day if you don't already know. You'll come up with potentially thousands of clashes but that's okay. Just Shift+Select everything and group it into a single group. I name this group ""All Clashes - 10/26/2022"" so I know it's everything clashed and what date I did it on. Now that everything's in a group under the Results tab, make sure ""Highlight Everything"" checkbox is unchecked, then on the Display Settings sidebar, turn off Transparent dimming and click the Hide Other button. Now that you've grouped them, you can see all clashes at once, but only in that group. Toggling between Hide and Dim Other allows you to see the whole job much easier. \n\nNow you can go to specific areas and select items as a group and assign them to trades much easier. Another quick tip: hold Spacebar+Left Click the mouse to toggle the pick tool to the select tool. Also use Crtl+Shift+Spacebar then pick drag select, which grabs everything within the selection window. Once you've done this, use the Filter by Selection dropdown and select ""inclusive"" which isolates this selection. Expand the clash group, select all of the items and right click, Group. This creates its own group so when you go back to the ""All Clashes"" group it's no longer there, which narrows it down much easier. \n\nOnce all this is done, create your Viewpoints and send it out. You can take 8 hours down to 1 hour, plus you're being far more diligent because you can see the project from an all-trades perspective. \n\nHope this helps!","{'polarity': 0.15038359788359792, 'subjectivity': 0.4334722222222222, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.15038359788359792,0.4334722222222222,Neutral

94,From my personal experience and career. Bim did not exist. We organically grew into Bim as technology improved through the years.\n\nI first started in steel manufacturing which the clients that we had did not have interest in modeling and Bim. They did not see the value or wanted to pay for that type of service. I transitioned to oil and gas which were very heavy on the modeling side and Bim started to be popular as well.\n\nMy point is you can get into using Bim by different avenues. There is not just one road in. I am not sure if things are different in countries around the world?\n\nGood luck.,"{'polarity': 0.048571428571428564, 'subjectivity': 0.6103174603174603, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.048571428571428564,0.6103174603174603,Neutral

96,"Yeah, I think I've seen a few posts here recently about contractors wanting to study BIM. The underlying question has to be ""What do you hope to achieve by that?""\n\nIf the answer is ""I work for a construction manager and we need to step up our coordination game"" -- okay, there may be some project-by-project relevancy -- if your firm has the kind of clients and contracts where BIM is already employed to some degree.\n\nIf the answer is ""I want to get out of contracting and into design consulting"" -- makes perfect sense. Though if that person has *zero* interest of ever getting into consulting, they could just be spinning their wheels.\n\nIf the answer is ""I want a promotion and to prove to my boss that they should invest $250k in new computers, software, learning curve time, and completely upend how we prepare shop drawings"" --- forget it. Never gonna happen.\n\nA decade ago someone who could drive BIM/Revit was worth gold no matter what. There was such high demand. I think that and the industry propaganda gave a false sense that if you were ever stagnating in your career you could just teach yourself Revit and \~\~*Boom\~\~* now you're making an extra $20k/year. That's just not the case anymore.\n\nI say this as someone who works in Revit daily as a design consultant -- the value of BIM is all about context. If someone wants to be a design consultant, definitely worthwhile. If they want to work in contracting, the value is questionable at best. If they want to work for a construction manager working on a commercial projects, probably worthwhile but depends on the scale of the projects.\n\nFor students, I would certainly direct them to learn architecture or engineering properly and learn BIM through interning. Most colleges can't teach BIM in any way that the industry actually uses. Great, someone can make a door schedule. If they're an electrical engineering intern that's a skill they can immediately blow out of the back of their mind. Now here's 30 things you *actually* need to know about dealing with linked models, worksets, and view properties so you don't corrupt our model and incur a week's worth of rework for the team.","{'polarity': 0.1418181818181818, 'subjectivity': 0.3804692082111436, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.1418181818181818,0.3804692082111436,Neutral
97,"This is a great post and completely agree. I'd bet we're about the same age and sounds like you've been using Revit for as long as I have (since 2006 for me). \n\nWe're a very high-level Revit MEP BIM firm and we use FabParts in Revit, full prefab, spooling, the whole nine. It's not easy and there's a LOT of moving parts, and all of our young kids (we call them ""kids"" but they're in their mid-20s) are rock stars at the *software* and the *process*, but boy let me tell you they still have years and years to go when it comes to understanding truly ""what"" they are designing lol. But they are doing awesome and they totally get the BIM process. \n\nWe had a really good opportunity to teach them something from the old school recently. Our office building was built in 1975 and we're helping the owner with a chiller changeout. We recreated the building in Revit architecturally and structurally and we're as-builting the MEP's but these original CD's were the actual blueprints from the 70s. We brought all of our younger crew into a conference room and let them look at what hand drafting set of plans looked like and we had them specifically focus on the MEP's and we asked them ""Now, how do you think they architectural background got on this sheet?"" They all looked at us with blank stares. ""The MEP drafter had to ***redraw it from scratch*** on every page. This is why MEP designers were very good back then because they were intimately connected to the building as a whole, because they had to redraw it to even begin their MEP layouts."" The lightbulb went off. We just grab a Revit model and link it in to our model and use Navis to speed up the processes of coordination, but we don't *get into the project with a deep dive* like previous generations were forced to. \n\nI say all this to come around to your point: Students should still learn architecture and engineering properly. Don't mistaken efficiencies for shortcuts. They need to *see the building, as a whole*. BIM is a great process that I believe in, but it's not just clicking a button that lays out a wall or duct or roof and call it a day. It gives you a peace of mind, and lets you peer into the future and see the construction process before it's ever built, allowing you to make critical decisions in advance that help schedule and save costs. This is the way, not so someone can start a little freelance business modeling things he doesn't really know, or serving some manager that doesn't really understand the investment or value of the process in its entirety.","{'polarity': 0.18040476190476196, 'subjectivity': 0.4151428571428571, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.18040476190476196,0.4151428571428571,Neutral
98,"Little younger than you, I started BIM in 2012 or so working for an audio/video design/build/consulting firm, primarily working on theater projects with a fair amount of K12 and corporate projects.\n\nI had the benefit of being an intern there at a time when only one guy knew how to drive Revit. So because I was cheap at an hourly rate, nobody cared that I would throw lots of time into developing their BIM standards, templates, and content. We were one of the only firms doing Revit on projects we bid on through our contracting wing, but we really only did it because we had an established consulting division and it made sense for our workflow to push everything toward BIM rather than have two divergent paths for project documentation. I would have no expectation subs on our project would work in BIM -- it's a lot of time investment that doesn't benefit the project and there's no good way to simply hand our BIM model off to them for their own use since they're going to have to redraw everything anyway to put it into a format their installers and the electricians would find useful.\n\nNow I work for a 450-ish person engineering firm. *Everybody* uses BIM -- but first and foremost they're mechanical/electrical/plumbing/structural/technology/etc designers. We'll happily teach anyone BIM if they have a strong enough foundation in one of those disciplines or if their a student in one of those fields. What we can't do is invest time in people who know BIM but have no experience whatsoever in any of our disciplines. The culture and org chart of our firm doesn't have room for generalists who are dedicated drafting positions that flip flop between trades as needed.\n\nOne generalist candidate I interviewed who had just a community college level of BIM experience with no engineering background and couldn't even see the forest for the trees. He tried to interviewing for a BIM Manager role and his primary experience from school was non-workshared models, doing architecture. No idea how to do workshared models, use shared parameters, host content on linked backgrounds, or anything relevant to our needs. Asked him about his experience in family creation and -- I swear to god -- his answer was about his siblings and relatives and mom and dad. Wildly unfamiliar with the territory he was in. Tech schools, by and large, just don't cater to how BIM actually gets used in practice. If he at least had a background in our trade we could've helped him out, but he had none whatsoever so then we would've had to teach him how to practically use Revit AND teach him our discipline. That's just a waste of time investment into someone who could up and leave at any moment if he decides he's not that interested in our discipline after all.\n\nI agree about the younger staff not knowing how projects used to be executed. I grew up on AutoCAD before I got into Revit so I've been there, done that. Our staff sometimes just assumes every project big or small will be in Revit and some don't know AutoCAD at all. When we do renovations one of my first questions for the architect is ""Are you going to develop a Revit model?"" Some choose to, some don't, some wing it, others have the structural engineer do a full 3D scan for complete precision. I had one architect who winged it -- we spent months coordinating everything only to discover when they ripped out the ceilings that the roof drains were completely different than they thought and messed up all the ceiling coordination -- all of that effort and collision detection flew out the window because they completely overlooked the LOD their existing conditions model was prepared for.\n\nBTW, I've been generally saying people should have a background in engineering before getting into BIM. I should caveat that and say they should just generally have experience in a chosen trade. Someone who didn't go to engineering school but has a lot of experience as a contractor in the field can be incredibly useful. They actually have an understanding of how contractors are going to build a project -- whereas the people with strictly a BIM background are liable to draw things in ways that would never pass a constructability review.","{'polarity': 0.09666950113378685, 'subjectivity': 0.47704081632653067, 'sentiment': 'Neutral'}",0.09666950113378685,0.47704081632653067,Neutral
